        <p>Depression is a symptom experienced by many, stemming from a variety of underlying issues. Similar to how a fever signals a physical problem, depression indicates that something is going wrong in our emotional world.</p>

            <h3>1. Learned Helplessness</h3>
            <p>A condition where a person believes they have no control over their circumstances. This belief often stems from past experiences—rooted in childhood—leaving a person feeling trapped in a cycle of negativity. The work of Martin Seligman highlights how this reduces one's sense of agency.</p>

            <h3>2. Self-Treatment Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>We often develop strategies as children that no longer work as adults. Rumination—constantly replaying thoughts—might have been a problem-solving tool then, but now it fuels anxiety and heaviness.</p>

            <h3>3. Dissociation</h3>
            <p>Disconnecting from our emotional experience to cope with unbearable pain. While it numbs the feelings, it eventually leads to feeling lost or detached. Unprocessed emotions eventually "leak out" as chronic sadness.</p>

            <h3>4. Avoidance and Unprocessed Emotions</h3>
            <p>Unconsciously avoiding painful thoughts leads to expressing pain in indirect ways, like projection or secondary anger. When emotions like grief (the loss of a mother) or trauma (abuse) are not processed, they manifest as emotional heaviness.</p>

            <h3>5. Lack of Meaning & Decision Paralysis</h3>
            <p>Depression arises from a lack of purpose or from being overwhelmed by life's complexities. The inability to navigate choices can lead to frustration and a sense of being stuck.</p>
